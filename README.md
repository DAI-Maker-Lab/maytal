# Maytal
Maytal is the temporary name for an open source hardware project that aims to empower local Indonesian water utilities (PDAMs) to track pressure throughout their distribution systems, enabling them to operate more efficiently. The current design is a proof-of-concept prototype to test initial parameters and constraints. The bill of materials cost is about $180 and most parts are available locally in Indonesia.
